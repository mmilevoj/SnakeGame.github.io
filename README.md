I don't know about you, but I tend to be quite nostalgic. We all remember the legendary Snake game on the even more legendary Nokia 3310. Well, I absolutley loved it as a kid, so I tought it would be a perfect project for practicing my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills. For the music theme I used a free demo version of the Squid Game show. You can try my Snake Game on: https://mmilevoj.github.io/SnakeGame.github.io
